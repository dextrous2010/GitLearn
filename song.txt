My best friend gave me the best advice,
He said each day's a gift and not a given right.
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind...
And try to take the path less traveled by.
That first step you take is the longest stride.

If today was your last day,
And tomorrow was too late.
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past,

Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day...

If today was your last day...

Against the grain should be a way of life,
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight.
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try,
So live like you'll never live it twice.
Don't take the free ride in your own life...
